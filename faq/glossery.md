# Glossery

## CORS

[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) \(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\) is a mechanism for servers to control client access to web assets.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system for managing code. It allows development teams to contribute code to the same project without causing code conflicts.

## Node

[Node](https://nodejs.org/) is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be written on the server-side.

## npm

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the package manager for [node](https://ionicframework.com/docs/faq/glossary#node). It allows developers to install, share, and package node modules.

## Observable

An observable is an object that emits events \(or notifications\). An observer is an object that listens for these events, and does something when an event is received. Together, they create a pattern that can be used for programming asynchronously.

## Protractor

[Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) is a testing framework written for and by the Angular team. Protractor can be used with test runners, like Karma, for end-to-end testing. Test runners allow you to quickly and programmatically verify code quality.

## CSS Variables

You may be familiar with variables from Sass. [CSS Variables](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/css-variables-why-should-you-care) enable the same functionality but are built into the browser. CSS Variables are available in all evergreen browsers.

## SASS

Sass is a stylesheet language that compiles to CSS. Sass is like CSS, but with extra features such as [variables](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_), [mixins](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins), and [loops](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_10).

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of JavaScript, which means it gives you JavaScript, along with a number of extra features such as [type declarations](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#basic-types) and [interfaces](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#interfaces).

## Unit tests

Unit Tests and unit testing are a way to test small pieces of code to see if they behave as expected. Unit testing frameworks include Jasmine, Mocha, QUnit, and many others.

## Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) bundles together JavaScript modules and other assets. It can be used to create single or multiple "chunks" that are only loaded when needed. Webpack can be used to take many files and dependencies and bundle them into one file, or other types.

## Web standards

The [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/) \(W3C\) is the standards organization for the Web. Together, industry leaders and the public work together to develop [web standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/), which are a set of protocols, specifications, and technologies that define the Web Platform.
