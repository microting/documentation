# Microting plugins

Microting develops a lot of different plugins to solve all sorts of business logic cases. All plugins are developed with CI in mind, so you will be able to see the current build status at Travis CI for each plugin.

All plugins have a web frontend, where you will be able to manage the plugin or utilize the functionalities it provides in a responsive mobile/desktop friendly environment.

All plugins will also provide some sort of REST API for third-party applications to use for integration. See each plugin for description of the API.

* Trash inspection
* Basic customer
* Basic case management
* Rentable items
* Multiple items recurring planning
* Single item/event planning
* [Outer + Inner resource time registration](outer-+-inner-resource-time-registration/) 

In order for you to be able to integrate with any plugin, you first need to obtain the access\_token as described in [Integration with Microting Backend](../integration-with-microting-backend/)

All plugins are released under MIT license, unless otherwise specified.
